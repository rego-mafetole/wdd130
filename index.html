        <p>Hello! My name is Regomoditswe Mafetole And I am from Gauteng, South Africa. I enjoy listening to music and
            watching movies and love eating pizza. I am currently studying Software Development through BYU-IDAHO. I am
            excited to learn more about creating websites. My end goal is to become a professional Software
            Developer and further my career in this field. I love to spend time with my close friends and family but
            most of the
            time I am with my mom. And I also like to play board games. One of the things I like doing the most is to go
            out
            shopping and trying new foods and items. I love going to church and the temple. I enjoy attending the YSA
            class. I love reading sci-fi books and also watching sci-fi and paranormal activities movies and series's.

        <p>"South Africa officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. Its nine
            provinces are bounded to
            the South of coastline that stretches along the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean. South
            Africa is known for its
            natural beauty, including diverse wildlife and landscapes, rich and complex culture as the "Rainbow Nation"
            with a blend of peoples and
            languages, its significant contributions to global sport with rugby and cricket, its deep and important
            history, and its role as a major
            African economic power." - wiki</p>
