        <p>"South Africa officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. Its nine
            provinces are bounded to
            the South of coastline that stretches along the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean. South
            Africa is known for its
            natural beauty, including diverse wildlife and landscapes, rich and complex culture as the "Rainbow Nation"
            with a blend of peoples and
            languages, its significant contributions to global sport with rugby and cricket, its deep and important
            history, and its role as a major
            African economic power." - wiki</p>
